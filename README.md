# Wilson and His Toys

This is a repository that powers [www.rangoric.com](https://www.rangoric.com).

Its built using [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

The content is from a fix of places, and the license files in the data folder will have more information on that, while basic notes are here.

## How to Fork & Make Your Own

Generally you can just use the website. If you want to pull it down locally or fork it to make it your own...

- About Me folder contents should be deleted, it lacks a license and so needs specific permission. You can fill it with your own data though, so no need to delete the folder itself.
- Blog folder has a license that allows it to stay.
- The MIT license can be changed to add your name and copyright notice.
- You will likely want to update some of the text to be more you. Like my name at the top of this file and references to 'Rangoric', you likely want your own flair there.

## Automation

The build is automated using Github Actions on each push to the working branch.
