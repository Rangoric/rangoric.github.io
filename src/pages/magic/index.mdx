<SEO title="Wilson Gearld Mead III's Magic Decks"/>

I generally play with in a couple of casual pods. One is family & friends, the other is friends. My decks tend to try and match their power level. But with the family & friends group it's hard, so while I have "strong" decks sometimes, I tend to run less interaction than they should have.

Some of my favorite decks

Krarkashima

Omnath

Tamiyo's Book Club

Kenrith, it's good to be the king
