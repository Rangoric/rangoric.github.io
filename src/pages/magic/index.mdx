<SEO title="Wilson Gearld Mead III's Magic Decks" />

I generally play with in a couple of casual pods. One is family & friends, the other is friends. My decks tend to try and match their power level. But with the family & friends group it's hard, so while I have "strong" decks sometimes, I tend to run less interaction than they should have, or not the normal way you'd run them.

Some of my favorite decks

## Krarkashima

Focuses on coin flips and gambling and other things. It used to be more streamlined but it was hilarious fun, but very miss or hit & game over. So it's going the carny route.

## Omnath

Landfall! Done as an experiment with basically no interaction. Very strong, but hard to notice.

## Tamiyo's Book Club

I really like this idea, but with how Tamiyo done done in recent sets I'm having to rework it.

Trying hard to not be super friends, but it might just be super friends.

## Kenrith, it's good to be the king

Not competitive but royalty & rules changes. It has some stax, but things that literally change the rules of the game in some way are more interesting and where I want to go with it.

## Sliver Queen / The Ur-Dragon in the largest deck ever

Remember when commander decks gave you oversized versions of the commander? This deck remembers.

## Liesa - Lifegain & Taxes

Was a Church of Orzova deck, now a Liesa deck. Before it was too passive, this is more active but looking for better cards for its new theme. Tends to gain so much life.

## Jaya Ballard, Burn it with friends

Lifelink, deathtouch, protection from red, and industructible. All things Jaya doesn't have, _yet_.

## Norin the Wary, Goblin Chaos

Norin is just fun to build. It could use a few other cards as the commander (Purphoros is an evil pick) but when this goes off it's just brutal.

## Gates & Shrines

All the shrines, and all the gates. The gates are actually rather useful (especially if you get out the gate that lets them all enter untapped), and also has an enchantress theme. One of my favorite decks to play, can build silly board states.
