# Resume of Wilson Gearld Mead III

I have over 13 years of professional experience using applications and websites to solve problems and help people do what they need to do.

## Technologies I've Works With

In .Net land I've worked with the "classic" 4.x framework for services and websites, in addition to migrating many of them to .Net Core.
I've been working with JavaScript since before the year 2000, and changed over to TypeScript almost immediately, but use JavaScript or TypeScript based on the project.
Kotlin is a newfound joy to work with. While I have a couple of years experience with it now, I split time on Kotlin and TypeScript.
I've done some work in Ruby on Rails, but most of that is limited to dealing with a legacy application.

## Programming Languages I'm Already Proficient In

I've played with a multitude of languages, and done work in more. However, I am all for learning more languages. Haskell and OCaml in particular are on my list looking for a good project.

- C# - Expert Level
- F# - Proficient
- JavaScript - Expert Level
- TypeScript - Expert Level
- Kotlin - Proficient

## Assorted Developer Technologies

- Azure - Azure Functions mostly, but other management and application log management
- GCS - Limited but I've been using it for almost 2 years for a kubernetes microservice deployment
- Azure Devops - It's similar to Github Actions, especially the yaml configuration. I've used this and JIRA for project management
- JIRA - Project Management and work item tracking
- Github - This is deployed to Github Pages via Github Actions
